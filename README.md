**Abstract:**   
A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian
ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on
recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of
changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current,
INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow
recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1,
includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon
as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a
minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at
plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential
duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action
potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the
interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature
stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa
in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic
stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal
[K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic
patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable
responses ("chaotic activity") are observed. The results are consistent with
recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these
phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.
